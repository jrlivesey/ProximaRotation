# Orbital elements of Proxima b

The orbital plane of Proxima b is presently unconstrained. In the paper, we claim that the initial longitude of ascending node (Ω) and longitude of pericenter (ϖ) of Proxima b have no bearing on our major result: the timescale on which Proxima b is captured into the synchronous rotation state. Here, we present 100 evolutions of Proxima b's rotational period, assembled with [VSPACE](https://github.com/VitualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplanet/vspace) using the CPL tidal model and an initial mutual inclination of 2º between Proxima b and Proxima c.

To execute:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
vspace vspace.in
```

The evolutions are virtually identical under our model. Therefore, we can comfortably set both parameters to zero initially.
